many people over the centuries, coming in various\r\n                    forms which have various ways of solving. Puzzles have played a role in people’s\r\n                    problem solving skills. Puzzle generators have allowed for more puzzles to be\r\n                    created, using various techniques to create interesting and challenging puzzles.\r\n                    The system requested by the client involves the creation of 3-Dimensional puzzles (manually and from the use of AI), testing of puzzles, sharing and rating of\r\n                    puzzles by other users, as well as the ability of downloading 3D printable files.\r\n                    Team Prometheus, has come up with a way to develop the system according to\r\n                    the client’s
